# Jumping Images

After dismantling the previously learned small demo, I am submitting it as a small project separately.

During my previous HTML5 learning, I came across this case on Course Factory, and it looked really beautiful. I decided to imitate it.

Implemented using HTML5 and CSS3, this project creates a dynamic effect where images transition from flat to standing when you hover the mouse over them. The shadows also change accordingly, making it a visually stunning effect.
